CSE 5542 Real-Time Rendering

This program implements bump mapping, as rendered on the tank model, as well as environment cube mapping, as rendered on the reflective sphere model. Planar shadows are used for the tank model model to appear more realistic. The sphere may be manipulated using trackball rotation with the mouse.

Note: It may take a few seconds for the models and textures to load.

Controls:
Left-click Mouse - Rotate sphere.
w - toggle wireframe.
ESC - exit the program.
